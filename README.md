# ZenX — Demo Webapp

This is a small demo web application built for the ZenX dashboard (AI TQA Review Management) screenshot you provided.

Run locally:

```bash
cd ZenX
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Files added/updated:
- `server.js` — Express server and simple API
- `public/index.html` — Frontend markup
- `public/styles.css` — Basic styles
- `public/main.js` — Frontend data fetching and UI wiring
- `package.json` — Updated with `express` dependency and start script

Notes:
- This is a minimal demo to match the attached design. I can extend it with real forms, auth, persistence, or a nicer UI library if you want.
